					<h5><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  I love working with children. Their energy is so pure that it gives me the excitement of the game as if it were my first time playing.
					<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Playing games that develope their coordination is one of the key parts of
					my teaching style. Children are constatnly growing physically and mentally so it is important to address this and make good habits. We play catching
					games, throwing games, footwork games, and off court tennis games.</p>
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Children need to focus on the fun so they can learn to love the game of tennis. It is my job to lead them
					through the foundation needed for their development as a person. This is one of my many prides to teach children the life of tennis.</h5></p>

					<b>Please note</b> that if your child is under the age of 6, <b>you must be present for the duration of the lesson.</b>
					
		<style> ol { list-style-type: circle; } </style>	
				<ol><h5>
					<li><b>Age:</b> Although there are no techincal age requirements, I do require a trial lesson to asses that they are ready for lessons. </li>
					<li><b>Racket:</b> This depends on your child's height. When picking a racket, make sure that the handle is no higher than the hip.</li>
					<li><b>Shoes:</b> Please bring athletic shoes. Flat soled shoes or sandals can be a potetial risk for injury due to falling.
					(please note that all tennis courts require non-marking shoes)</li>
					<li><b>Water:</b> Please bring water for hydration is key! Sport drinks tend to have a lot of sugar and salt which can then actually dehydrate you.</li>

						<h5>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  I use the 10 and Under tennis balls. These balls are slowed down and bounce at the height of children
						allowing them to bring out their full potential of their game. 10 and Under Tennis follows the same principles
						of other children sports like t-ball, soccer, and basketball where they have smaller equipment to fit the
						children playing the sport.</h5>
