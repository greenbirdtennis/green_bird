						<h5>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I use the 10 and Under tennis balls. These balls are slowed down and bounce at the height of children
						allowing them to bring out their full potential of their game. 10 and Under Tennis follows the same principles
						of other children sports like t-ball, soccer, and basketball where they have smaller equipment to fit the
						children playing the sport.</h5>

					<h3 class="article-title">Junior Development</h3><br>
					
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I love working with children. Watching them grow and develope their tennis game is one of the simple
					rewards that life gives me.
					<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some say I have a child's heart so playing games that develope their coordination is one of the key parts of
					my teaching style. Children are constatnly growing physically and mentally so it is important to address this and make good habits. We play catching
					games, throwing games, footwork games, and of court tennis games.</p>
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Children need to focus on the fun so they can learn to love the game of tennis. It is my job to lead them
					through the foundation needed for their development as a person. This is one of my many prides to teach children the life of tennis.</p>
