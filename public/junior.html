						<h2 class="title">Junior skill overview</h2>
					
						<p>Children are happy when they are having fun. Parents are happy when their children are happy... but not when they aren't learning.
						</p><p>Listed below are the basic foundation skills and goals targeted for kids at certain ages. Although this is not concrete,
						it is a guideline which you can use to track your children's progress so that you parents can stay happy too.</p>
						
						<h4><em>Age 3-5</em></h4>
						<p>At this age, I begin to introduce them to the court by beginning to teach them some of the lines and where play happens.
						This is through coordination games and challenges that begin the basic tennis foundation.<br/> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also at this age, they begin to learn how
						the tennis racket is an extention of their hand, making the stroke a more familiar and natural to them.</p>
												
						<h4><em>Age 6-9</em></h4>
						<p>At this age there is a wider range for level of play. This depends on your child's coordination. Like in the above description for the
						younger students, most of the skills for this age group is coordination based. The coordination games and skills will be done in an intermediate to advance
						difficulty and can always challenge the student to whatever level they want to aspire to.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The skills will be done for coordination, technique, strength, and
						introductory point/strategy play.</p>
						
						<h4><em>Age 10+</em></h4>
						<p>This is the age where children are at their most natural coordination level. Coordination drills will be addressed in lessons and practiced with a racket, but strongly encouraged
						5min practice at home before or after lesson. <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here I take a look at the goals and desire of the student wether they want to play on a team or just with
						friends, we work the basic strategies and skills that are needed for any kind of play.</p>
