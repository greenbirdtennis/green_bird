					<h3> Site under construction...</h3>
					
					<p>Wether you are just starting out or an all time veteran, tennis is a great way to stay healthy and socialize... But it isn't always the easiest to coordinate with everyone's schedule. If you need a hitting partner or looking to improve your skills, I am here for you!</p>

<P>I look around and see a lot of people with elbow braces, knee braces, and sometimes back braces. Within 5 minutes of watching them play, I can already see and pinpoint several of the mistakes of how they are over working their game. In the 12 years of my tennis career, I have never had an injury that put me indoors and away from my racket. I believe this is due to the skills and knowledge I have acquired about injury prevention as well and body mechanics.</p>
                                        
                                        <h4> " The depressing thing about tennis is that no matter how good I get, I'll never be as good as a wall. "
